// Package conformance drives the renderer against real terminal emulators and
// compares the resulting screen against ground truth.
//
// The renderer keeps a model of what the terminal is currently showing and
// writes only the difference between that model and the next frame. When the
// model drifts out of step with reality the output is still valid ANSI and
// still looks plausible; it just paints the wrong thing. Asserting on escape
// sequences cannot catch that, because there is no single correct sequence to
// compare against.
//
// So these tests compare against ground truth instead: run a sequence of
// frames incrementally on one terminal, paint the final frame from scratch on
// another, and require the two screens to match. Any disagreement is a bug in
// the incremental path.
//
// This lives in its own module because the reference emulator is a cgo package
// with a newer Go requirement, and neither cost belongs in the library that
// ships to users.
