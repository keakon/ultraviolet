// A screen that shrinks narrow enough to rewrap a row, then grows again, is the
// case the nightly run kept finding and the corpus could not hold: the inputs
// it minimised to were long, and what they were really exercising is short.
//
// Shrinking makes the terminal rewrap a row too wide to fit, which pushes
// content onto rows that are off-screen at the time. Growing brings those rows
// back, still holding it. The renderer never painted them, so nothing in its
// model says they are dirty, and the residue used to survive every later frame.
