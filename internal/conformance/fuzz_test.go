// model, so the very next write lands inside the cluster that disagreed and
// destroys it, and every write after that is similarly adrift. A codepoint
// missing from there on says the two disagree about width, which is a given
// here, not that the renderer dropped it.

// filled is exactly that kind of consistent wrongness. A first paint and a full
// repaint agree perfectly while both drop a glyph.
//
// So this target asserts something absolute instead. The most recently drawn
// line must appear on its row, with every codepoint of every drift-prone
// cluster it contained present at least as many times as it was drawn.

// Codepoints are counted one at a time rather than as whole clusters because
// the emulators disagree about how a cluster lands in cells: x/vt splits a

// them separately keeps the assertion blind to layout and sharp about loss,
// which matters, since dropping a combining mark is the bug this target was
// written to catch. Where an emulator swallows a codepoint outright it is
// listed in that oracle's drops, so the tolerance is per-emulator and named
// rather than applied to everyone. Extra occurrences are tolerated as
